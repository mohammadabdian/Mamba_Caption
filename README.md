# HMT: A Hybrid Mamba–Transformer Architecture for Image Captioning

Official implementation of HMT – a novel encoder-decoder architecture for image captioning that combines Mamba's linear-time efficiency with Transformer's cross-modal alignment capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

**Encoder**: Vision Mamba with dual-path (horizontal + vertical) 2D scanning + gated feature fusion  
**Decoder**: Causal Mamba blocks + cross-attention for visual grounding  
**Backbone**: CLIP ViT-B/32 (frozen)

## Abstract

Image captioning requires efficient modeling of visual-linguistic interactions. Transformers excel at cross-modal alignment but suffer from quadratic complexity, while SSMs like Mamba offer linear scaling but struggle with multi-modal integration. HMT unifies both paradigms through: (1) a Vision Mamba encoder with cross-shaped 2D scanning that preserves spatial topology, (2) a gated feature fusion mechanism, and (3) a causal Mamba decoder with cross-attention. Evaluated on MS COCO and Flickr30k, HMT achieves superior accuracy with reduced computational overhead.
